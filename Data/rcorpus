Switzerlands economy combining low unemployment financial stability and a large external payments surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it said     The OECD in its annual report on Switzerland picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pickup in inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to  pct this year from an estimated two pct in  and a small rise in consumer price inflation to  pct after last years sharp fall to  pct from  pct in      But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the industrial nation OECD area     Assuming an average exchange rate of  Swiss francs to the dollar this year against  in the second half of  the report forecast a  pct rise in exports and a  pct rise in imports this year after rises of  pct and  pct respectively in      The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years     But given Switzerlands large external surplus there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDPWhich if only in a small way would contribute to improving international balances the OECD said     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year with a  pct growth rate after several years of relative weakness it noted     In  private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a  pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall GDP it added     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into  and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors it said     As a consequence growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in      But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry two major service sector earners of foreign exchange     The longterm appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could lead to a loss of international market share for both it said     Particularly for the banks recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system which has shown substantial flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed required  To preserve its competitive position it said  REUTER

Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policymaking meeting two weeks ago money market economists said     The numbers were a little disappointing but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank     Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Feds policy has been unchanged up to today     Although Volckers statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in todays data which covered the twoweek bank statement period ended yesterday     This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Feds decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched salepurchase agreements for the first time since April of last year economists added     Todays data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large  billion dlrs economists said     The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago But there was a clearly justified need for them There was nothing ominous     The Fed couldnt have waited until the start of the new statement period today If it had it would have missed its reserve projections added Security Pacifics Bannon     A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large singleday net miss in reserve projections in the latest week     Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higherthan expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Feds discount window which averaged  mln dlrs a day in the latest week compared with many economists forecasts of about  mln     For the twoweek bank statement period as a whole the daily borrowing average more than doubled to  mln dlrs from  in the prior period     There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday so I am not too bothered about the borrowings said Scott Winningham of JS Winningham and Co The Wednesday average rose to  mln dlrs from  mln a week earlier     Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system economists said     For the time being the Fed is following a neutral path with fed funds at about six to  pct said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp I expect it to continue in that vein     Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs added First Chicagos Johnson Banks excess reserves averaged  billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period down from  billion in the previous one     After the Fed declined to assign a  target growth range to the wayward M money supply measure last week little attention was paid to a steeperthananticipated  billion dlr jump in the week ended February      Looking ahead economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollars progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy     The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollars effect on Fed policy said First Chicagos Johnson Of course it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak it wont pull back from easing  Reuter

Frances right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its  growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year     Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its  inflation estimate a half percentage point to  per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and  per cent from a  per cent target written into the annual budget last september     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation budgetcutting rigour and pay restraint     But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises     And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year perhaps in the autumn to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April      The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year     The big question is whether the governments policy of wage moderation will be maintained he added     The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout  per cent this year with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity     But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation Edmond Maire meeting with Chirac today renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices     Calling the governments policies unbalanced and unjust he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     Andre Bergeron a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communistled CGT the largest of Frances unions declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority     But with unemployment nearing  per cent last month and still rising government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands     Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that commented Michel Develle economist at recentlyprivatised Banque Paribas     Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year partly blamed by the government for higher inflation had undermined the unions power and popularity he said     Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast perhaps to  or  per cent this year against last years  per cent     But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed he commented     Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a  per cent surge in January living costs     But they claimed it was a onceoff phenomenon that should have no knockon impact on the rest of the year     Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that so long as the government kept wages under control     Prices could rise  per cent in the first three months of  and two per cent in the first half year fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute INSEE  Marais said But the second half year should be better he added     Ironically one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit several analysts said     So long as public sector wages are held down higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth they said      Reuter

Italys strong economic revival has led some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive     I think all this foreign interest in the socalled Italian miracle is really exaggeratedForeign observers always oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism says Luigi Spaventa one of Italys leading economists and a professor at Rome University     According to Spaventa these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last  years with Italy one minute seen as the bad boy of Europe and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration     I think theres a lot of exaggerationOnce it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to Italy to study this That was another story about nothing  like writing about a black cat in a dark room     Spaventa in tune with other economists and industrialists here stress Italys recent achievements particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises but warns that the economy is still vulnerable      Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat SPA ltFIATM and ltING C Olivetti and C SPA are booming the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed Expectations by some experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the worlds fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism     Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its secondrate status among the major industrialised countries     Only this week it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five G  comprising the United States Japan West Germany France and Britain     Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system     But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy economists and industrialists say     We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti     He says that while Italys recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved     The countrys huge state sector deficit high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems experts say     The size of the state spending deficit  estimated at  billion lire in  and targetted at  billion lire this year  means there is a risk inflation could spiral again says Carlo Scognamiglio head of the private Luiss university in Rome     Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in September  and by January this year was running at  pct but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness economists and industrialists say     And unemployment was running at  pct nationally last October according to the latest official data     Recent official data showed that of a total  million people seeking work in October  almost  pct were aged between  and  Unemployment in the south was running at  pct more than double that in the industrial north     The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product GDP would rise rise three pct in  after expanding  pct in  But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment     Another problem is Italys reliance on imported raw materials The country imports around  pct of its fuel needs     This factor actually worked sharply in Italys favour last year when lower energy costs helped slash the countrys trade deficit to  billion lire  by year end from  billion lire in      But economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences     If Italy truly wants to be counted among the worlds top industrialised nations it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities economists say     Italy has no controls on insider trading     The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls  a European Community directive calls for these to be dismantled by   but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures economists say     Even today if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse I doubt Id find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that says Spaventa  REUTER

Directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widelypopular Standard and Poors  Stock Index futures pit an exchange executive said     The petition calls for elimination of dual trading a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account     But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called frontrunning where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers     Leo Melamed CME special counsel said directors will rule on the petition on Wednesday but added that a special S and P Advisory Committee has been studying S and P  futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within  days     In addition to a recommendation on dual trading Melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P  futures and futuresoptions and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit     Melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations     CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board accepts the members petition this week a rule change will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for approval     If the board does nothing or rejects the petition request a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within  days Beyer said     Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made it will confuse the issue     Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading     Although Jonathan Wolff senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges     Its a question of the integrity of the person you do business with Wolff said     Futures traders who act as brokers however maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits     To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors said John Michael vice president at First Options of Chicago     What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved he said     Furthermore the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes frontrunning risky to a brokers livelihood he said     If I ever discovered a broker doing it frontrunning or even suspected him of doing it I would cut him off Michael said     An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit for instance will fill orders for  to  contracts a day at  dlrs per contract floor sources said  Even figuring what is considered a typical  pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative     Frontrunning by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move but also the risk of losing the brokerage business Michael said  Reuter

Last weeks White House shakeup has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the armstoIran scandal will serve a third term sources close to the Fed say     But they said that no decision on the appointment which must be filled this August has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind     Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan who resigned last week when exsenator Howard Baker was named as his replacement was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him     It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker first appointed in  by President Carter will not be offered a third term by President Reagan     Only Volckers key allies in the Reagan administration VicePresident George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker kept Regans recent maneuvering at bay the sources said     Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story quickly shot down by others in the administration that Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the council of economic advisers had been chosen to replace Volcker     But as the administrations credibility was increasingly under fire it became clear that Regans power to bring about such changes was on the wane     The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship     As a moderate Republican Baker is also unlikely to share the rightwings opposition to Volcker     This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get said one source when asked about the possibility of Volckers reappointment     Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question Volckers departure would definitely undermine US leadership foreign exchange analysts say     US officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation     The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry but recent statements by Volcker in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation signalled the politicallyindependent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position     And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw exactly eyetoeye on the dollar was seen as an indication of Bakers support for the Fed chairman     Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volckers reappointment to the Fed in mid     The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February  he decided to ensure a good working relationship in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely     Regan Treasury Secretary during President Reagans first term was formerly head of Wall Streets largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be Americas preeminent economic spokesman     He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker whose political skills undermined that ambition and who financial markets took much more seriously     But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay Is the president going to ask him he wouldnt stay otherwise said one Hed have to be asked said Stephen Axilrod formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vicechairman of Nikko Securities Co International     Otherwise the list of potential candidates is not aweinspiring And if Volcker left this Augsut he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years     Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience  the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years  is dangerous coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability     An experienced successor therefore would seem a necessity One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal     But Shultz too may have been damaged by the armstoIran scandal while vicechairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at  years old as too young for the job     Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan frequently an informal presidential economic adviser New York Fed President E Gerald Corrigan Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman and Sprinkel     Long a Regan protege Sprinkels chances may be damaged by his patrons departure from the White House  Reuter

Last weeks White House shakeup has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the armstoIran scandal will serve a third term sources close to the Fed say     But they said that no decision on the appointment which must be filled this August has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind     Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan who resigned last week when exsenator Howard Baker was named as his replacement was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him     It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker first appointed in  by President Carter will not be offered a third term by President Reagan     Only Volckers key allies in the Reagan administration VicePresident George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker kept Regans recent maneuvering at bay the sources said     Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story quickly shot down by others in the administration that Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the council of economic advisers had been chosen to replace Volcker     But as the administrations credibility was increasingly under fire it became clear that Regans power to bring about such changes was on the wane     The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship     As a moderate Republican Baker is also unlikely to share the rightwings opposition to Volcker     This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get said one source when asked about the possibility of Volckers reappointment     Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question Volckers departure would definitely undermine US leadership foreign exchange analysts say     US officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation     The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry but recent statements by Volcker in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation signalled the politicallyindependent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position     And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw exactly eyetoeye on the dollar was seen as an indication of Bakers support for the Fed chairman     Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volckers reappointment to the Fed in mid     The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February  he decided to ensure a good working relationship in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely     Regan Treasury Secretary during President Reagans first term was formerly head of Wall Streets largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be Americas preeminent economic spokesman     He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker whose political skills undermined that ambition and who financial markets took much more seriously     But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay Is the president going to ask him he wouldnt stay otherwise said one Hed have to be asked said Stephen Axilrod formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vicechairman of Nikko Securities Co International     Otherwise the list of potential candidates is not aweinspiring And if Volcker left this Augsut he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years     Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience  the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years  is dangerous coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability     An experienced successor therefore would seem a necessity One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal     But Shultz too may have been damaged by the armstoIran scandal while vicechairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at  years old as too young for the job     Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan frequently an informal presidential economic adviser New York Fed President E Gerald Corrigan Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman and Sprinkel     Long a Regan protege Sprinkels chances may be damaged by his patrons departure from the White House  Reuter

This mornings sharp decline in coffee prices following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization ICO quotas will be shortlived Dutch roasters said     The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said     The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present there is a shortage of quality he said     Average prices fell to around  cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around  cents within a few weeks the roaster added     Dutch Coffee Roasters Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis     There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement he said     There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation de Vries added     With this in mind and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a handtomouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below  cents a lb roasters said  Reuter
